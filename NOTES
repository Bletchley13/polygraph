Fixed bug in lcseq that effectively caused gap penalty to be rounded up to
nearest integer. This means in our published results, our gap penalty
was effectively 1.0

lcseq_tree- use_fixed_gaps is not in a working state.

current noise workloads are generated using samples from eval traces.
better practice may be to remove the samples being used for noise from the
eval traces.

when reconstructing streams, streams not allowed to continue from one
trace to another.

discuss bound_similarity issues.
(mostly right for conjunction, could be attacked for subseq)

Reason for max (5) tokens in fp estimate
